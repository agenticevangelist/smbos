Overview

Components are one of the key building blocks of the design system. Their systematic reuse helps to create visual and functional consistency across products.

Components

Each component has been designed and coded to solve a specific UI problem, such as presenting a list of options, enabling submission of a form, providing feedback to the user, and so on. All of the components in Carbon have been designed to work harmoniously together, as parts of a greater whole.

Additional components, maintained by the Carbon community, are available in Community assets.
